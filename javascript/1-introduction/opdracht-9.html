    <p>With const sum = number++ + 2 the result is 5, because with postfix increment the value is first used in the expression and then incremented: 3 + 2 = 5.</p>
    <p>With const sum = ++number + 2 the result is 6, because with prefix increment the value is first incremented (3 + 1 = 4) and then used in the expression: 4 + 2 = 6.</p>
