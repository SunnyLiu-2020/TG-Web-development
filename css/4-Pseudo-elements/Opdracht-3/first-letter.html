    <p>Glory to God in the highest. And on earth peace to men of good will. We praise You. We bless You. We adore you.
        We glorify You. We give You thanks for Your great glory. O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father almighty. O
        Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-begotten Son. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father: you Who take away the sins
        of the world, have mercy on us. You Who take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. You Who sit at the
        right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are holy. You alone are the Lord. You alone, O Jesus
        Christ, are most high. Together with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>
