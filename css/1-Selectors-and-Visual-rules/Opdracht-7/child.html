    <p>A child selector targets certain elements that share the same parent element. In this example all p elements are
        targeted that have a div as parent element. Paragraph 2 and 3 are highlighted because they share the first div
        as parent element.Paragraph 4 and 5 are also highlighted because they share the second div as parent.</p>
