    <p>The general selector is also called the general sibling selector. It targets a certain type of element that
        follows another element and shares the same parent element. In this case paragraph 5, 6 and this paragraph are
        highlighted because the style declaration targets any p that shares the same parent element as div (the body
        element) and paragraph 5, 6 and this paragraph come after the div.</p>
