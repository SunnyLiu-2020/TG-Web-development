    <h1>Adjacent selectors</h1>

    <p>This is paragraph 1.</p>
    <p>This is paragraph 2.</p>

    <div>
        <p>This is paragraph 3.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is paragraph 4.</p>
    <p>This is paragraph 5.</p>

    <p>Adjacent selectors are also known as adjacent sibling selectors. The reason why paragraph 4 is highlighted is
        because the style declaration targets the p element that shares the same parent element with div (in this case
        the body element) and immediately follows the div element.</p>
